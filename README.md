# Mealient

## DISCLAIMER

This project is developed independently from the core Mealie project. It is NOT associated with the
core Mealie developers. Any issues must be reported to the Mealient repository, NOT the Mealie
repository.

## What is this?

An unofficial Android client for [Mealie](https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/). It enables you to
easily access your recipes using via Android phone. The main goal is to have everything stored
locally to access it without Internet connection which is impossible with web site version.

## Status

Current version is a very early alpha which supports a tiny portion of the Mealie capabilites. There
is a lot of work ahead, do not expect much. Having said that, you can list your recipes and read the
instructions/ingredients for each of them.
