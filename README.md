## What is this?

An unofficial Android client for [Mealie](https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/). It enables you to
easily access your recipes using an Android device. The main advantage over website is that
recipe data is stored locally and can be accessed without the Internet connection.

## Status

Current version is a very early alpha which supports a small subset of the Mealie capabilities.
It supports both API of older Mealie 0.5.6 and newer 1.0.0. Displays the list of recipes,
information about each of the recipes. Moreover, you can create a recipe from the app!
